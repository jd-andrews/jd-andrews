## Hi, I'm JD

Developer and all-around creative currently living in Detroit, MI.

I kind of use github as a catch-all for what I'm playing around with, but the starred projects are at least *slightly* finished. Alternatively you can find all of my projects with a blurb about the on my website - [jda.photos](https://www.jda.photos/#work).
